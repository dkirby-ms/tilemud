# tilemud

Minimal README for the tilemud project.

## Overview
Tilemud is a small project that implements tile-based logic and related tooling. This repository uses spec-kit for writing specifications and the `specify` runner to execute them.


## Specification-driven development

[Speckit](https://github.com/github/spec-kit) is used to develop this game.

- /constitution Fill the constitution with the minimum requirements for a vite-based web client for a massively multiplayer tile placement game. 

Review the constitution.md and make any edits. 

- /specify I want a web app that allows users to login to the site, and then create a character that persists over subsequent logins. The user can select a name and character archetype. I already have an Entra ID external identities tenant setup for oauth with an app registration and userflow.

Use Copilot to complete the specification, addressing any areas that need clarification 

/plan React frontend with static content for now - no databases connection required for now - data is embedded in content for mock character creation. Site is responsive and ready for mobile. 

Review the plan and other content and adjust as needed either by editing the markdown directly or through Copilot prompts.

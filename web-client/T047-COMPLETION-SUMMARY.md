# T047 Completion Summary
**Task**: Connection state machine implementation  
**Status**: ✅ COMPLETE  
**Date**: 2025-01-27  

## Overview
Implemented a comprehensive WebSocket connection state machine with React integration for managing connection lifecycle, authentication, admission control, queue management, and error handling.

## Files Created/Modified

### Core State Machine
- `web-client/src/features/connection/machine/types.ts` - Complete type definitions for state machine
- `web-client/src/features/connection/machine/stateMachine.ts` - Full FSM implementation with transitions
- `web-client/src/features/connection/machine/index.ts` - Updated exports

### Connection Service  
- `web-client/src/features/connection/ConnectionService.ts` - WebSocket service with state machine integration
- `web-client/src/features/connection/connectionStore.ts` - Zustand store for reactive state management

### React Components
- `web-client/src/features/connection/components/ConnectionStatusComponent.tsx` - Full connection UI component
- `web-client/src/features/connection/components/index.ts` - Updated exports

### Index Files
- `web-client/src/features/connection/index.ts` - Clean exports
- `web-client/src/features/connection/hooks/index.ts` - Placeholder
- `web-client/src/features/connection/services/index.ts` - Placeholder

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. State Machine (FR-019)
- **States**: 12 connection states including disconnected, connecting, authenticating, queued, connected, error states
- **Events**: 16 transition events covering user actions, system events, timeouts, and errors
- **Transitions**: Complete transition logic with side effects and context updates
- **Side Effects**: Timer management, WebSocket operations, user notifications

### 2. WebSocket Service (FR-020)
- **Connection Management**: Automatic WebSocket connection with protocol handling
- **Message Handling**: Complete protocol implementation for auth, admission, queue updates
- **Timer Management**: Connection, authentication, admission, retry, grace period timers
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error categorization and recovery strategies

### 3. State Store Integration
- **Zustand Store**: Reactive state management with subscription middleware
- **Selector Hooks**: Optimized access to specific state slices
- **Event Integration**: Service events integrated into store updates
- **Notification System**: Auto-dismissing notifications with type-based styling

### 4. React Components
- **Status Indicator**: Visual connection state with icons and colors
- **Control Buttons**: Context-aware connect/disconnect/retry/cancel buttons
- **Detail Display**: Connection metadata, queue info, error details
- **Notifications**: Dismissible notification system with auto-timeout

### 5. Connection States Covered
- ✅ Disconnected → Connect flow
- ✅ Authentication with token management
- ✅ Admission request with outcome handling
- ✅ Queue management with position updates
- ✅ Connected state maintenance
- ✅ Error states (rejected, rate limited, drain mode, maintenance)
- ✅ Reconnection with grace period
- ✅ Retry logic with exponential backoff

### 6. Protocol Compatibility
- **Authentication**: `auth_success`/`auth_failure` messages
- **Admission**: `admission_response` with outcomes (ADMITTED, QUEUED, REJECTED, etc.)
- **Queue**: `queue_update` and `queue_promoted` messages
- **Maintenance**: `drain_mode` and `maintenance` messages
- **Status**: `queue_status` polling requests

## Technical Architecture

### Type Safety
- **Strict TypeScript**: Modern const assertions for enum-like behavior
- **Type-only imports**: Clean separation of types and runtime code
- **Union types**: Proper discriminated unions for state and event types

### State Machine Pattern
- **Pure Functions**: Transition function is pure with explicit side effects
- **Immutable Updates**: Context updates via spread operations
- **Predictable Behavior**: Every state/event combination handled explicitly

### React Integration
- **Hooks**: Custom hooks for different aspects of connection state
- **Performance**: Selector-based subscriptions to avoid unnecessary re-renders
- **Cleanup**: Proper resource cleanup and timer management

## Testing Readiness
- **Pure Functions**: State machine logic easily unit testable
- **Mock Support**: Service can be mocked for component testing
- **State Verification**: All states and transitions can be programmatically tested
- **Timer Control**: Timer-based behavior can be controlled in tests

## Next Steps
This implementation provides the foundation for:
- T048: Connection UI components (status displays, controls)
- T049: Queue position display and management
- T050: Error messaging and recovery flows
- T051: Reconnection management
- T052: Connection retry logic (already partially implemented)

## Verification
✅ TypeScript compilation clean  
✅ Build successful  
✅ Export structure correct  
✅ State machine coverage complete  
✅ WebSocket protocol implementation matches server contracts

# T060: Frontend Connection State Machine Unit Tests

## Objective
Create comprehensive unit tests for the frontend connection state machine reducer logic, validating all state transitions, event handling, and edge cases.

## Test Coverage Required

### 1. State Transitions
- Test all valid state transitions (12 states Ã— 16 events = potential combinations)
- Validate state persistence and immutability
- Ensure invalid transitions are rejected appropriately

### 2. Event Handling  
- Connection lifecycle events (connect, disconnect, error, timeout)
- Queue management events (enqueue, promote, dequeue)
- Admission flow events (admit, reject, replace)
- Grace period and reconnection events

### 3. Context Management
- Connection metadata updates
- Queue position tracking
- Error state preservation
- Timeout handling

### 4. Edge Cases
- Concurrent event processing
- Invalid event payloads
- State machine recovery from inconsistent states
- Memory leak prevention

## Files to Test
- `web-client/src/features/connection/machine/stateMachine.ts`
- `web-client/src/features/connection/machine/types.ts`

## Implementation Plan
1. Create test file with comprehensive FSM validation
2. Mock external dependencies and timers
3. Test state transition matrix completeness
4. Validate context updates and side effects
5. Ensure deterministic behavior under concurrent conditions

## Success Criteria
- All state transitions tested with proper assertions
- Event handling validates expected outcomes  
- Edge cases covered with graceful degradation
- Performance characteristics measured for production readiness

## ⚡ Quick Guidelines
- ✅ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ❌ Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- 👥 Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-01
- Q: What is the primary authentication / identity model for establishing a unified session between the web client and server? → A: External IdP (OAuth2/SSO tokens)
- Q: What performance targets should we adopt for initial load and real-time action latency (p95)? → A: Initial load ≤3s p95; action latency ≤200ms p95
- Q: How frequently should critical player progress be durably persisted during active play (beyond session end)? → A: Every action (before acknowledge)
- Q: What is the maximum acceptable data staleness window for cached reads (before forcing refresh from durable state)? → A: ≤100ms window
- Q: How should client version compatibility and deprecation be managed? → A: Strict build/version match required (lockstep)

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a player using the web client, I can connect to the game server and interact (move, chat, perform actions) with immediate, consistent feedback while my progress and state are reliably preserved between sessions.

### Supporting User Journeys
1. First-time connection: Player loads web client → initiates connection → receives current authoritative character and world state → begins interaction.
2. Returning session: Player reconnects after prior session → receives last persisted state (inventory, location, stats) → resumes seamlessly.
3. Intermittent network loss: Connection drops → client retries → upon success receives differential or full sync → resumes without duplicated actions.
4. Version mismatch: Player opens outdated client → system detects incompatibility → user is prompted to refresh/update instead of entering unstable state.
5. Degraded dependency: Cache layer unavailable → gameplay continues using persistent store with acceptable performance impact notification (internal only) and no user-facing data corruption.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a valid player identity and connectivity, **When** the player opens the web client and connects, **Then** the client receives authoritative character state and can issue actions within an initial load time of ≤3s p95.
2. **Given** an active session, **When** the player performs an action (e.g., move), **Then** the client view updates to reflect the new state and other relevant players receive propagated changes with end-to-end action round-trip latency ≤200ms p95.
3. **Given** an active session, **When** the network briefly disconnects and reconnects within a retry window, **Then** the session is restored without loss of unsaved progress and without duplicating previously acknowledged actions.
4. **Given** the persistent store is available but the cache layer is unavailable, **When** the player performs standard actions, **Then** the system continues to function correctly with only potential performance degradation and no stale or inconsistent data presented.
5. **Given** the player uses any client version identifier not exactly matching the server's current build version, **When** attempting to connect, **Then** the system blocks gameplay and instructs the player to update (hard lockstep enforcement, no grace window).
6. **Given** the player ends a session intentionally (logout or browser close), **When** they reconnect later, **Then** their last persisted progress (inventory, stats, location) is restored accurately.
7. **Given** a server restart during an active session, **When** the server comes back online and the player reconnects, **Then** no acknowledged actions are lost because each state-mutating action was durably persisted before acknowledgement.

### Edge Cases
- Simultaneous rapid actions queued during near-disconnect conditions → system must apply in correct order or reject with clear feedback.
- Cache contains stale state that conflicts with persistent data → reconciliation favors authoritative persistence rule set; client receives unified correct state.
- Partial persistence failure (e.g., success writing transient state, failure writing durable state) → operation must roll back or surface consistent fallback outcome (never half-applied state) [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: rollback policy].
- Client attempts action after version deprecation cutoff → action rejected with version update requirement.
- Player reconnects after exceeding inactivity timeout → treated as fresh session (new sync) rather than incremental delta.
- Persistent store temporarily unavailable → player actions paused with user-facing message vs. silent data loss [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: acceptable outage messaging].
- Cache warm-up race on hotspot entities → must avoid exposing mixed-era state to users.

## Negative / Failure Scenarios
- Connection denied due to capacity limits → user receives clear retry messaging.
- Integrity check mismatch (e.g., out-of-order action sequence) → server rejects action; client informs user without desync.
- Exceeded retry attempts for reconnection → session declared closed and user returned to initial connect state.

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
Each requirement describes externally observable behavior or obligation of the integrated experience (not internal implementation detail).

**FR-001**: The system MUST establish a unified session between web client and game server by validating externally issued OAuth2/SSO access tokens from the designated identity provider and rejecting expired or tampered tokens.
**FR-002**: The system MUST deliver an initial authoritative state payload (player entity + essential world context) meeting the initial load performance target defined in **NFR-002**.
**FR-003**: The system MUST reflect player-initiated actions in the client UI and propagate to other affected participants while meeting the action latency budget defined in **NFR-001**.
**FR-004**: The system MUST persist critical player progress (inventory, stats, character position, key flags) on every state-mutating action before sending success acknowledgment to the client, and also upon session end to finalize any pending state.
**FR-005**: The system MUST prevent presentation of stale data older than 100ms (p95) between durable truth and client-visible state for freshness-sensitive fields (position, health, inventory deltas); stale detections trigger forced refresh.
**FR-006**: The system MUST continue core gameplay operations when the transient performance layer (cache) is unavailable, without data loss (performance may degrade).
**FR-007**: The system MUST guarantee idempotent handling of resubmitted actions after reconnect to avoid duplicates.
**FR-008**: The system MUST provide a re-synchronization mechanism after transient disconnect that restores consistent state without manual user intervention using exponential backoff with full jitter at ~1s, 2s, 4s, 8s, 16s (max 5 attempts ≈31s total); after exhaustion it surfaces a RETRY_LIMIT_REACHED state.
**FR-009**: The system MUST enforce strict build/version lockstep: only clients matching the server's advertised build identifier may establish a session; mismatches are rejected with an update-required response (no multi-version coexistence).
**FR-010**: The system MUST validate all client-originated actions against authoritative rules before committing effects; rejected actions return structured errors.
**FR-011**: The system MUST ensure atomic application of multi-step state changes (all-or-nothing from player perspective) via a reject-on-failure model: partial internal failures roll back entirely (no partial side effects). Client receives structured error code=ACTION_ATOMIC_ROLLBACK with retryable flag.
**FR-012**: The system MUST expose a readiness/health indication reflecting integration-critical dependencies (durable store reachability, transient cache availability, session capacity).
**FR-013**: The system MUST protect user-specific state from access by other users (authorization boundary). Scope: single PLAYER role only (no moderator/admin yet). Cross-user reads/writes must be rejected with error code=FORBIDDEN.
**FR-014**: The system MUST log session lifecycle events (connect, disconnect, reconnect, version rejection) with 30-day retention. Logs must exclude raw tokens, IP addresses, and personal identifiers beyond opaque user_id + hashed session_id. Sensitive payloads redacted (inventory summarized, error details trimmed).
**FR-015**: The system MUST provide user-visible error states for dependency outages, version mismatch, capacity limits, and authentication failure.
**FR-016**: The system MUST recover gracefully from server restarts so that acknowledged progress is not lost beyond last guaranteed checkpoint.
**FR-017**: The system MUST enforce an inactivity timeout after which session resources are released and a reconnect becomes a fresh session.
**FR-018**: The system MUST ensure ordering guarantees for sequential player actions within a session (no reordering visible to users).
**FR-019**: The system MUST furnish metrics: connect_attempts_total, connect_success_total, reconnect_attempts_total, reconnect_success_total, version_reject_total, action_latency_ms histogram, state_refresh_forced_total, cache_hit_ratio gauge, active_sessions_gauge, derived latency_p95.
**FR-020**: The system MUST provide a consistent error contract: `{ code: string; category: 'AUTH' | 'VERSION' | 'CAPACITY' | 'RATE_LIMIT' | 'VALIDATION' | 'INTERNAL' | 'DEPENDENCY' | 'CONSISTENCY'; message: string; retryable: boolean; correlation_id: string; details?: object }`.

### Non-Functional / Quality Requirements
**NFR-001**: Real-time action round-trip latency: ≤200ms p95 (stretch goal ≤120ms p95; non-blocking).
**NFR-002**: Initial state load time: ≤3s p95 (stretch goal ≤2s p95; non-blocking).
**NFR-003**: Availability: ≥99.5% monthly gameplay session continuity (stretch ≥99.9%). Measured as successful action acknowledgments / attempted actions excluding planned maintenance.
**NFR-004**: Data consistency on reconnect: 0 acknowledged actions lost (per-action durability); at most 1 in-flight unacknowledged action may be lost if failure occurs before acknowledgment.
**NFR-005**: Scalability: Baseline 500 concurrent active sessions per node; stretch 1500 via horizontal room sharding.
**NFR-006**: Security: No unauthorized cross-user state access. Initial threat surface: token forgery, replay, sequence spoofing, stale reconnect token reuse. Detailed threat model deferred.
**NFR-007**: Privacy: Logs contain only opaque user_id, hashed session_id, action type enums, truncated error details; no raw tokens or IP addresses.
**NFR-008**: Observability: Alert if reconnect_success_total / reconnect_attempts_total < 0.98 (5m) OR version_reject_total / connect_attempts_total > 0.05 (15m) OR action_latency_ms p95 > 200ms for 3 consecutive windows.

### Open Questions / Clarifications Needed
1. Detailed threat model expansion (vector enumeration & mitigations)
2. Availability escalation policy (incident response thresholds)
3. Cache eviction & adaptive coalescing tuning parameters
4. Localization / i18n strategy for user-facing status banners (future scope)

All prior clarification markers have been resolved and incorporated above.

### Assumptions (Subject to validation)
- Existing character creation & login flow already implemented in earlier features.
- The integration does not introduce new gameplay mechanics; scope is connective tissue and consistency.
- Web client can surface structured error codes distinctly from generic failures.
- Persistent store remains the source of truth; transient layer only optimizes read/write patterns.
- Real-time delivery uses an existing bidirectional channel (unspecified here) — details intentionally excluded per guideline.

### Out of Scope (for this feature)
- Designing new combat or progression systems.
- Changing underlying storage technology choices (capabilities defined, not tech brands).
- Implementing new authentication provider integrations beyond what is chosen in clarification.
- Full analytics dashboard (only raw metrics availability required).

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Player Session**: Represents an active connection context; attributes include session identifier, user identity reference, activity timestamps, protocol version, reconnect token.
- **Character Profile**: Persistent representation of player progress (stats, inventory summary, location reference, progression flags).
- **Transient State Entry**: Ephemeral derived state shards (e.g., recent position trail, proximity lists) used to accelerate responses; must never be sole source of truth.
- **Action/Event Message**: Structured description of a player action or server broadcast (type, sequence number, timestamp, payload metadata).
- **Synchronization Token**: Versioned marker capturing last applied state boundary (sequence number + logical time) enabling differential resync.
- **Health Indicator Composite**: Aggregated readiness signals for core dependencies and capacity.

### Relationships (Conceptual)
- Player Session links to one Character Profile (active selection).
- Action/Event Messages are associated with a Player Session (origin) and may mutate Character Profile state.
- Synchronization Token references the point-in-time alignment between Character Profile and transient state entries.

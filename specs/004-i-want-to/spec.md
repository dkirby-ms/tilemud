# Feature Specification: Large-Scale Multiplayer Tile Game Backend Service

**Feature Branch**: `004-i-want-to`  
**Created**: 2025-09-29  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "I want to build a game service that serves as a game backend for a tile placement game. Players may range in count from 1 to hundreds using the service at any given time. Players interact with each other through instanced battles with groups of other playerts and environmental and AI controlled gameplay elements such as NPCs or scripted scenarios. Players also interact with each other through social channels like grouping, guilds, and private chats."

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a player, I want to log into the tile game backend, join or create a group or guild, enter an instanced battle containing a tile-based playfield shared with other participants and AI-controlled entities, place and manipulate tiles according to game rules, and use social channels (group chat, guild chat, private messaging) to coordinate while the system reliably scales from a single player session to hundreds of concurrent players.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a registered/logged-in player and no existing active battle, **When** the player requests to start an instanced battle (solo mode), **Then** the system creates an isolated battle instance with an initialized tile map and assigns the player to it.
2. **Given** multiple players in a pre-formed group, **When** the group leader initiates an instanced battle, **Then** all group members are placed into the same new battle instance with a synchronized initial tile state.
3. **Given** a player inside an active battle instance, **When** they place a tile per game rules, **Then** the updated tile state becomes visible to all other participants in that instance within ‚â§150ms end-to-end (client action to applied state) at the 95th percentile.
4. **Given** a battle instance containing AI/NPC entities, **When** scripted environmental events trigger (e.g., NPC move, environmental hazard), **Then** the instance state updates and all players receive consistent event notifications.
5. **Given** a player belongs to a guild, **When** they send a guild chat message, **Then** only members of that guild connected to the service receive the message in order sent.
6. **Given** two players with mutual communication permissions, **When** one sends a private message, **Then** only the target player receives it and delivery success or failure is known to the sender.
7. **Given** a player disconnects temporarily during an instanced battle, **When** they reconnect within a defined timeout window [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: reconnection grace period], **Then** they resume the same instance state (tile layout, position, pending effects) without data loss.
8. **Given** a battle instance reaches its end condition (e.g., objective met), **When** the end condition is detected, **Then** final results (scores, outcomes, rewards) are produced and persisted for later retrieval.
9. **Given** system load of up to ~1,000 concurrent connected players across multiple active instances, **When** standard gameplay actions occur (tile placement, chat messages), **Then** the system maintains performance meeting latency targets (tile placement ‚â§150ms p95, chat delivery ‚â§150ms p95) and does not exceed yet-to-be-defined throughput and error rate thresholds.

### Edge Cases
- Single-player scenario: player starts solo instance and immediately ends (ensure lifecycle still recorded).
- Simultaneous tile placements targeting same board cell by different players are resolved by predetermined player initiative order (higher priority wins; losers receive rejection with precedence reason).
- Player attempts action in an instance they are no longer part of (should be rejected with an explanatory reason).
- NPC scripted event collides with a player move in the same tick [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: server-side sequencing priority].
- Chat spam or rate limit exceed events [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: message rate limits].
- Player removed from guild while in battle using guild chat (message visibility after removal) [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: immediate revocation behavior].
- Instance capacity reached when new player tries to join (reject join once 32 active player slots filled).
- Sudden server failure mid-instance (persistence / recovery expectations) [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: durability guarantees].
- Cross-instance message attempt (should not be delivered; verify isolation).

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST allow a player to create or join an instanced battle session (instance) corresponding to a tile-based playfield.
- **FR-002**: System MUST initialize each new instance with a deterministic starting tile map according to game rule set version [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: rule versioning approach].
- **FR-003**: System MUST support grouping players prior to instance creation so that grouped players enter the same instance together.
- **FR-004**: System MUST enforce isolation so that game state mutations (tile placements, NPC events) in one instance are not visible in others.
- **FR-005**: System MUST broadcast approved tile placement updates to all active participants of the instance.
- **FR-006**: System MUST validate tile placement actions against game rules (placement legality, resource costs, timing constraints) and reject invalid actions with a reason code [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: catalog of rejection codes].
- **FR-007**: System MUST support AI / NPC / scripted environmental events that can modify the instance state and be observable to all participants.
- **FR-008**: System MUST provide real-time social communication channels: group chat (temporary party), guild chat (persistent membership), and private direct messages between two players with permission.
- **FR-009**: System MUST preserve ordering of messages per channel scope (group, guild, private) as perceived by recipients and deliver each chat message to all intended recipients within ‚â§150ms end-to-end at the 95th percentile; ordering behavior across shards/instances remains to be clarified [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: cross-shard ordering model].
- **FR-010**: System MUST allow creation and management of guild entities (join, leave, membership list retrieval) [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: guild size limits and governance rules].
- **FR-011**: System MUST track and persist battle outcomes (win/loss/objective metrics, rewards) accessible to relevant players after instance completion.
- **FR-012**: System MUST handle player temporary disconnection with a grace period allowing seamless rejoin retaining prior state.
- **FR-013**: System MUST enforce a hard cap of 32 concurrent players per instance for the initial release and reject additional join attempts with a standardized capacity-exceeded error.
- **FR-014**: System MUST prevent players from performing in-instance actions if they are no longer active participants (e.g., removed, disconnected past grace period, instance ended).
- **FR-015**: System MUST provide a mechanism to end an instance when victory/defeat or other termination condition is reached and transition all participants to a post-instance state.
- **FR-016**: System MUST protect privacy of private messages so that only intended recipients can access their content [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: retention & audit policies].
- **FR-017**: System MUST support scalable concurrent operation sustaining ~1,000 simultaneous connected players across multiple instances in the initial release (future scalability beyond this may be addressed in later features); associated KPIs (latency, error rate, throughput) to be defined in subsequent clarification.
- **FR-018**: System MUST apply rate limiting and/or anti-spam controls for chat and action submissions [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: thresholds and penalty behaviors].
- **FR-019**: System MUST log critical game events (instance creation, completion, rule violations, moderation events) for auditing and debugging [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: log retention period].
- **FR-020**: System MUST ensure that conflicting tile placement attempts affecting the same location are resolved deterministically using a predefined player initiative priority order (higher initiative wins; all losing actions are rejected with a standardized precedence-conflict error code).
- **FR-021**: System MUST supply a consistent snapshot of instance state to reconnecting players.
- **FR-022**: System MUST reject cross-instance interaction attempts (e.g., tile placement referencing another instance ID) with an error.
- **FR-023**: System MUST provide guild and group membership change propagation to relevant online players within a target latency [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: latency target].
- **FR-024**: System MUST support scripted scenario triggers (time-based or condition-based) that can queue or execute instance events.
- **FR-025**: System MUST provide a standardized error code schema for rejected player actions and failed message deliveries [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: schema structure].

*Ambiguities & Clarifications required are explicitly marked; no implementation technology is specified.*

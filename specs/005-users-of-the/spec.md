# Feature Specification: Web Client Login, Character Selection, Server Connection & In-Game Chat

**Feature Branch**: `005-users-of-the`  
**Created**: 2025-10-01  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Users of the web-client should be able to login, select a character, and then connect to a running instance of a server using the selected character. Once in the server, they should be able to chat with other players connected to the same server."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a returning player, I open the web client, successfully authenticate, see a list of my existing playable characters, choose one, and am connected into a live game server instance where I can exchange chat messages with all other currently connected players on that same server instance.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** an authenticated user with at least one existing character, **When** they open the character selection view, choose a character, and explicitly click a "Connect" action/button, **Then** the system establishes a game session using that character and displays confirmation that they are connected (e.g., shows other player chat stream) and they can submit a chat message which is visible to other connected players.
2. **Given** a user who has multiple characters, **When** they select a different character before joining, **Then** the system connects them using only the newly selected character and no data from an unselected character is applied to the session.
3. **Given** a user connected to a server instance, **When** they send a chat message inside an allowed size and rate, **Then** all currently connected players on that same server instance see the message in ordered sequence.
4. **Given** a user connected to a server instance, **When** another player joins, **Then** subsequent chat messages from that player appear for the user (historical backlog rules [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: is prior chat history shown to late joiners?]).
5. **Given** a user connected to a server instance, **When** they disconnect intentionally (logout or leave) or lose connection, **Then** they are no longer considered present for new chat deliveries (re-join behavior [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: should last character auto-reconnect?]).

### Edge Cases
- Character list empty: authenticated user has zero characters (behavior [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: offer creation? block access?]).
- Multiple simultaneous browser tabs using different characters (policy [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: allow concurrent sessions per account?]).
- Rapid message sending approaching rate limits (expected handling [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: throttle vs. reject?]).
- Oversized chat message exceeding maximum permitted length (expected result: rejection with user-facing error ‚Äî max length value [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]).
- Server instance at capacity when attempting to connect (capacity handling [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: queue, alternate instance, or error?]).
- Network drop mid-session (rejoin window duration [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]).
- Attempt to send message before server session fully established (should be blocked with clear status message).
- Duplicate character selection submission (idempotent handling required; only one session established).
- Offensive or disallowed content (moderation expectation [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: filter, report, or none in scope?]).
- Time skew or ordering issues for chat messages (ordering rule: chronological by accepted timestamp ‚Äî conflict resolution [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]).

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST allow a user to authenticate via Entra ID External Identities (SSO) before any character selection or server connection occurs.
- **FR-002**: After successful authentication, system MUST present the user with a list of their available playable characters (if any) containing at minimum each character's name and an unambiguous identifier.
- **FR-003**: System MUST prevent entering a game server instance until exactly one character is selected.
- **FR-004**: System MUST establish a player game session bound to the selected character such that all in-session actions and chat messages are attributed only to that character.
- **FR-005**: System MUST ensure a user cannot simultaneously join the same server instance with the same character more than once (idempotent join / duplicate prevention).
- **FR-006**: System MUST provide clear feedback of connection state transitions: (a) connecting, (b) connected, (c) disconnected, (d) reconnecting (if supported). [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: is automatic reconnection in scope?]
- **FR-007**: While connected, the user MUST be able to submit textual chat messages associated with the active character.
- **FR-008**: System MUST deliver each submitted chat message to all other currently connected players on the same server instance (excluding or including sender echo [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: should sender see their own message as delivered entry?]).
- **FR-009**: Chat messages MUST appear to all recipients in a consistent, deterministic order (defined ordering rule: ascending accepted timestamp). [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: tie-break rule if two messages share same acceptance time]
- **FR-010**: System MUST enforce a maximum message length and reject messages exceeding it with a user-visible error. [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: numeric maximum]
- **FR-011**: System MUST enforce a reasonable rate limit on message submissions to mitigate spam. [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: threshold + time window]
- **FR-012**: System MUST prevent sending chat messages before the server session is confirmed established.
- **FR-013**: System MUST remove a user's presence from the server instance promptly upon logout, browser close (within a grace period), or connectivity timeout. [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: grace period duration]
- **FR-014**: System MUST NOT expose characters belonging to other users in the selection list.
- **FR-015**: System MUST restrict chat visibility so only players in the same server instance receive the messages (no cross-instance leakage).
- **FR-016**: System MUST clearly communicate any failure to join (e.g., capacity reached) with a user-understandable reason. [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: list of possible join failure reasons in scope]
- **FR-017**: System MUST handle an empty character list by presenting guidance or an action path (e.g., create character or exit). [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: is character creation part of this feature or separate?]
- **FR-018**: System MUST ensure that disconnect events (intentional or unintentional) stop further chat reception and sending until reconnection.
- **FR-019**: System MUST log session start and end events for audit / operational insight. [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: required retention / visibility of logs]
- **FR-020**: System MUST provide baseline validation & sanitization of chat input to prevent injection of disallowed control sequences. [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific prohibited content scope]
- **FR-021**: System MUST expose a visible indicator of other players currently connected (at minimum a count or list). [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: which form‚Äîcount vs. names?]
- **FR-022**: System MUST prevent switching characters without first leaving the current server session (no mid-session identity swap).
- **FR-023**: System MUST support at least one concurrent active session per authenticated user (multi-tab policy beyond that [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]).
- **FR-024**: System MUST surface a user-facing error if message delivery fails (e.g., disconnected state) instead of silently dropping.

*Ambiguity Examples (retained intentionally for clarification):*
- **FR-025**: System SHOULD (or MUST?) provide limited historical chat backlog on join. [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: backlog inclusion and size]
- **FR-026**: System MUST moderate or filter disallowed language. [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: scope and enforcement approach] (If out of scope, remove.)
- **FR-027**: System MUST define maximum simultaneous players per server instance. [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: numeric capacity]

### Assumptions & Dependencies (Optional)
- Existing character creation functionality already exists outside this feature scope (not implemented here). [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: confirm]
- There is at least one running server instance available for connections. [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: is server instance selection user-driven or automatic?]
- Persistent storage of characters and user accounts exists. [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: any constraints on freshness or caching?]
- Reliability targets (uptime, latency) not specified and need definition for test acceptance. [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]

### Open Questions (Consolidated)
1. How is an empty character list handled (create flow included or separate)?
2. Is server instance selection automatic, or can users choose among multiple instances?
3. Are users shown prior chat history on join? If yes, how much and in what order?
4. What is the maximum chat message length?
5. What are the chat rate limit thresholds (messages per time window)?
6. Are offensive content filtering or moderation requirements in scope?
7. Should the sender see their own chat message echoed in the feed?
8. Tie-break rule for identical timestamps (e.g., sequence counter vs. insertion order)?
9. Numeric capacity limit per server instance?
10. Reconnection grace period for transient disconnects?
11. Multi-tab / multi-character concurrent session policy?
12. Required backlog (if any) and limit (message count or time span)?
13. Required visibility for other players (names vs. count only)?
14. Join failure reason taxonomy to standardize user messaging?
15. Logging retention and access expectations?
16. Character switching policy after connection (explicit leave only?).
17. Sanitization scope (which characters or formats are disallowed)?

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **User**: Represents an authenticated account; attributes: unique identifier, associated characters. (Credentials / auth details out of scope.)
- **Character**: Playable persona owned by a user; attributes: character ID, name, status (active/disabled), ownership link to User.
- **Server Instance (Game Session Context)**: Logical environment players join; attributes: instance ID, capacity, current player list, status (accepting connections / full).
- **Player Session**: Association of (User, Character) actively connected to a Server Instance; attributes: session ID, connection state, join timestamp, last activity time.
- **Chat Message**: A discrete text communication; attributes: message ID, sending Player Session reference, content text, accepted timestamp, (optional) delivery order token.
- **Presence Roster**: Derived view listing active Player Sessions in an instance.

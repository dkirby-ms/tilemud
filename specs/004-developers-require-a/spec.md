# Feature Specification: Developer Infrastructure: Local Docker Compose for Redis & PostgreSQL

**Feature Branch**: `004-developers-require-a`  
**Created**: 2025-09-28  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Developers require a docker-compose file for setting up the necessary infrastructure to dev and test. The docker-compose file should include the necessary infra components such as Redis and PostgreSQL. The expectation is that developers will run the server and web-client locally (not in containers) development, with PostgreSQL and Redis running in containers."

## Execution Flow (main)
```

4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## Clarifications
### Session 2025-09-28
- Q: How should database migrations be executed in this workflow? ‚Üí A: Manual command after infra up (Option A)
- Q: How should default port overrides be provided? ‚Üí A: Environment variables in `.env` (POSTGRES_PORT, REDIS_PORT)
- Q: What healthcheck timing policy do you want for PostgreSQL and Redis readiness? ‚Üí A: Balanced (interval 5s, timeout 2s, retries 12 ‚âà60s max)
- Q: Should this same docker-compose setup be officially supported for CI automation? ‚Üí A: No (local development only; CI uses different provisioning)
- Q: Should local test scripts automatically start/stop infra if not running? ‚Üí A: Yes (auto-start if absent; leave running after)

Clarification Impact:
- Selected manual approach; compose will not run migrations automatically.
- Documentation must specify a single developer-invoked command (e.g., an npm script) executed only after healthchecks pass.
- Port overrides via `.env` ensure low-friction conflict resolution.
- Balanced healthchecks define deterministic readiness window (~60s max wait).
- CI usage explicitly excluded; compose stability guarantees are local-only.
- Test scripts will detect missing infra and auto-start it (idempotent), but will NOT auto-stop to preserve developer iteration speed.


## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a developer working on the TileMUD server or web client, I need a single, documented command to start required infrastructure services (PostgreSQL and Redis) so that I can run the Node.js server and React web client locally without manually installing or configuring those backing services on my machine.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a clean repository clone with Docker + Docker Compose installed, **When** the developer runs the documented compose startup command, **Then** both a PostgreSQL container and a Redis container are started and become reachable on documented host ports from the host network (e.g., localhost) for the server process.
2. **Given** the infrastructure stack is running, **When** the developer starts the server locally, **Then** the server can establish successful connections to PostgreSQL (for persistence) and Redis (for caching / presence) using environment variables documented alongside the compose file.
3. **Given** the infrastructure stack is running, **When** the developer stops it using the documented shutdown command, **Then** containers terminate cleanly and (by default) persisted database data remains available across restarts unless a documented command for a clean reset is executed.
4. **Given** another developer wishes to reset all infrastructure state, **When** they run the documented reset/destroy command, **Then** volumes (or data directories) are removed and subsequent startup yields a fresh empty database and cache.
5. **Given** a new developer without local PostgreSQL/Redis installed, **When** they follow the quickstart instructions, **Then** they can execute integration and contract tests that depend on those services without additional machine-level setup.

### Edge Cases
- Developer already has services running on the default host ports ‚Üí Developer sets `POSTGRES_PORT` and/or `REDIS_PORT` in `.env` to alternate free ports; compose uses variable substitution.
- Container crashes during startup due to port conflicts ‚Üí Guidance will recommend checking running processes / adjusting env ports (no automated port detection included in scope unless later expanded).
- Need for seeded schema/migrations at first run ‚Üí Developer runs manual migration command after `docker compose up -d` once services report healthy (compose does NOT auto-run migrations).
- CI usage ‚Üí Explicitly out of scope; CI will provision its own ephemeral services (compose file not guaranteed stable for CI workflows).
- Test script invocation with infra down ‚Üí Scripts auto-start infra via compose, then proceed; they do not tear it down automatically.
- Handling of sensitive credentials (passwords) ‚Üí Must not commit secrets; rely on `.env` with example template.

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: A Docker Compose configuration MUST define services for PostgreSQL and Redis only (no application containers) to support local development.
- **FR-002**: The PostgreSQL service MUST expose a stable host port (default 5432) and allow configuration via environment variables loaded from a developer-managed `.env` file (with a committed `.env.example`).
- **FR-003**: The Redis service MUST expose a stable host port (default 6379) and require no password by default unless security requirements later mandate it (document future option).
- **FR-004**: The compose setup MUST enable persistent PostgreSQL storage across container restarts via a named volume.
- **FR-005**: The compose setup MUST allow developers to optionally reset (wipe) all persisted data with a documented single command (e.g., `docker compose down -v`).
- **FR-006**: The repository MUST include clear quickstart documentation (section or file) showing start, stop, reset, and troubleshooting commands for infra.
- **FR-007**: The server MUST be able to connect using environment variables without code changes when compose stack is up (variables documented: DB host, port, user, password, database name; Redis host and port).
- **FR-008**: The compose definition MUST declare healthchecks for PostgreSQL and Redis using a Balanced policy: interval 5s, timeout 2s, retries 12 (approximate maximum wait ~60s) to provide deterministic readiness for tests.
- **FR-009**: The solution MUST avoid committing real credentials; any defaults MUST be non-sensitive placeholders.
- **FR-010**: The compose file MUST be compatible with Docker Compose v2 syntax and not rely on deprecated fields.
- **FR-011**: A developer MUST be able to override default ports via environment variable substitution without editing the compose file, supporting `POSTGRES_PORT` (default 5432) and `REDIS_PORT` (default 6379) defined in `.env`.
- **FR-012**: The feature MUST include guidance for running database migrations via a single documented manual command executed after infrastructure services are healthy (compose itself MUST NOT auto-run migrations).
- **FR-013**: The compose setup SHOULD NOT introduce dependencies beyond Docker/Compose (no requirement for Make, Taskfile, etc.).
- **FR-014**: Local test scripts MUST automatically start the compose infra (if not already running) before executing tests and MUST leave it running afterward to optimize iteration; scripts MUST be idempotent on repeated invocation.
- **FR-015**: The docker-compose configuration is NOT an official CI dependency; CI pipelines will use separate provisioning scripts or managed services (local compose stability guarantees do not extend to CI).
- **FR-016**: Auto-start logic MUST detect readiness via healthchecks and abort with a clear error message if services fail to become healthy within the ~60s window.

*Ambiguity markers retained pending product/engineering clarification.*

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Infrastructure Service Definition**: Conceptual grouping describing each backing service (name, purpose, default port, persistence behavior, healthcheck expectation).
- **Environment Configuration**: Set of variables required by the application layer to connect to infra (DB_HOST, DB_PORT, DB_USER, DB_PASSWORD, DB_NAME, REDIS_HOST, REDIS_PORT). No secrets committed; example values only.

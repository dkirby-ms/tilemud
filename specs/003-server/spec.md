# Feature Specification: Scalable Game Service Backend

**Feature Branch**: `003-server`  
**Created**: September 26, 2025  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "I want to build a game service that serves as a game backend for a tile placement game. Players may range in count from 1 to hundreds using the service at any given time. Players interact with each other through instanced battles with groups of other playerts and environmental and AI controlled gameplay elements such as NPCs or scripted scenarios. Players also interact with each other through social channels like grouping, guilds, and private chats."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   → If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   → Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   → Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   → If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   → Each requirement must be testable
   → Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   → If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   → If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-09-26
- Q: How should the system resolve simultaneous conflicting tile placements targeting the same board cell? → A: Batched queued resolution (collect all in a tick/window, apply deterministic ordering rule)

### Primary User Story
Players engage in a persistent tile placement game ecosystem where they can (a) participate in instanced tactical tile battles with other players and AI/ environmental elements, (b) cooperate or compete in PvP arenas, and (c) socialize through grouping, guilds, and private chat channels – all supported by a scalable backend handling from solo play to hundreds of concurrent participants.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a solo player starts a session, **When** they enter a battle instance, **Then** the system provisions an isolated game state supporting optional AI/NPC participation.
2. **Given** a group forms a battle instance, **When** the instance starts, **Then** only invited/assigned players and configured AI entities can affect that instance state.
3. **Given** a large PvP arena (100+ players) is active, **When** multiple players submit tile actions simultaneously, **Then** the authoritative state processes them under defined resolution rules and propagates updates within target latency.
4. **Given** a guild chat channel exists, **When** a member sends a message, **Then** all online guild members receive it, and offline members can access recent history on reconnect (within retention policy). **[NEEDS CLARIFICATION: retention duration]**
5. **Given** a player disconnects mid-instance, **When** they reconnect within an allowed grace period, **Then** they resume their role without unfair advantage or loss of state. **[NEEDS CLARIFICATION: grace period length]**
6. **Given** an instance reaches its victory condition, **When** the final action is resolved, **Then** rewards, rankings, and logs are generated and persisted.
7. **Given** system load increases sharply, **When** new large-scale arena joins are requested, **Then** capacity limits or queuing rules apply with user-facing feedback. **[NEEDS CLARIFICATION: max arena capacity tiers]**

### Edge Cases
- Simultaneous conflicting tile placements targeting the same board cell.
- Player reconnects after grace period expiration.
- NPC script stall or failure mid-instance.
- Duplicate guild names requested concurrently. **[NEEDS CLARIFICATION: uniqueness scope/global?]**
- Burst chat spam in public or guild channels. **[NEEDS CLARIFICATION: rate limits?]**
- Attempt to merge two partially filled arenas for load balancing.
- Instance soft-fail (e.g., >50% players disconnect). **[NEEDS CLARIFICATION: abort criteria?]**

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST support instanced battle sessions isolated from other concurrent sessions.
- **FR-002**: System MUST scale to support sessions ranging from 1 player to hundreds of concurrent participants (across multiple instances and arenas).
- **FR-003**: System MUST differentiate interaction modes: instanced battles, large PvP arenas, social/guild spaces, and private chats.
- **FR-004**: System MUST manage AI-controlled entities (NPCs, scripted scenarios) participating in instances alongside players. **[NEEDS CLARIFICATION: max AI per instance]**
- **FR-005**: System MUST enforce authoritative tile placement validation and resolve conflicts via batched queued resolution windows (collect all submissions in the tick, apply deterministic ordering rule, then commit winning placement atomically).
- **FR-006**: System MUST support player grouping (ad‑hoc parties) and persistent guild membership with role distinctions. **[NEEDS CLARIFICATION: guild role set?]**
- **FR-007**: System MUST provide private, guild, group, and public chat channels with delivery guarantees (at-least-once or exactly-once). **[NEEDS CLARIFICATION: guarantee type?]**
- **FR-008**: System MUST persist battle / arena outcomes, rewards, and activity logs.
- **FR-009**: System MUST allow reconnect within a defined grace period without loss of character or instance state. **[NEEDS CLARIFICATION: grace seconds?]**
- **FR-010**: System MUST expose session discovery / joining for arenas, and invitation / assignment for instanced battles.
- **FR-011**: System MUST provide scalability controls (capacity thresholds, queueing, shard/segment criteria). **[NEEDS CLARIFICATION: sharding basis (geography, load, mode)?]**
- **FR-012**: System MUST apply rate limits to chat and action submissions. **[NEEDS CLARIFICATION: baseline rates?]**
- **FR-013**: System MUST track per-session metrics (players active, actions/sec, AI load, latency p95) for observability.
- **FR-014**: System MUST maintain social graph relationships (friend/block lists). **[NEEDS CLARIFICATION: block list scope?]**
- **FR-015**: System MUST support administrative moderation (mute, kick from instance, guild dissolution requests).
- **FR-016**: System MUST record and version rule configurations used in each resolved instance for audit.
- **FR-017**: System MUST expose replay data for completed instances (sequence of authoritative state changes). **[NEEDS CLARIFICATION: retention duration?]**

### Key Entities
- **Player**: Human or AI-controlled participant with identity, session presence(s), social affiliations.
- **Instance (Battle)**: Isolated tactical tile session with bounded participants (players + AI) and lifecycle (pending → active → resolved/abandoned).
- **Arena**: Large shared competitive environment with higher participant counts and continuous or cyclical rounds.
- **Tile Board**: Spatial state container tracking tile placements, ownership, and environmental effects.
- **AI Entity / NPC**: Scripted or autonomous participant with behaviors and state constraints.
- **Guild**: Persistent social organization with membership roster, roles, and channels.
- **Group/Party**: Temporary cooperative unit for entering instances.
- **Chat Channel**: Logical stream (guild, party, private, arena, system) with retention and moderation attributes.
- **Match / Outcome Log**: Immutable record of end-state metrics, rewards, and applied rule set.
- **Replay Timeline**: Sequence of ordered authoritative events enabling deterministic reconstruction.

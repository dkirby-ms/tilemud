## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As an authenticated user, I want to explicitly end my session so that my account is protected and no further actions can be performed under my identity until I intentionally sign in again.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** an authenticated user on any in-app screen, **When** the user initiates logout, **Then** the system terminates the active session and redirects the user to the / public (unauthenticated) entry point.
2. **Given** an authenticated user with multiple application tabs/windows open, **When** the user logs out in one tab, **Then** all other open tabs proactively reflect logged-out state without requiring user interaction (real-time propagation requirement).
3. **Given** an authenticated user with unsaved in-progress input (e.g., form), **When** the user initiates logout, **Then** the user is warned about potential data loss and can confirm or cancel. No draft saving is required at this time.
4. **Given** an authenticated user, **When** logout succeeds, **Then** no further protected resources can be accessed without new authentication.
5. **Given** a network disruption occurring after the client clears local session state but before the server acknowledges logout, **When** the user attempts further navigation, **Then** the system treats the user as logged out (defensive stance) and presents sign-in path.
6. **Given** a user whose session has already expired server-side, **When** they click logout, **Then** the user is shown a normal signed-out experience with no error leakage.
7. **Given** an authenticated user, **When** the user chooses logout and quickly presses the action multiple times, **Then** only one logout operation is processed and UI remains stable (idempotent behavior).
8. **Given** an authenticated user, **When** logout is initiated during an ongoing background request, **Then** subsequent responses do not re-establish authenticated state or leak data.
9. **Given** an authenticated user, **When** logout completes, **Then** any locally cached sensitive data (e.g., character roster, profile) is purged or rendered inaccessible. Clear any user-specific data related to the app.
10. **Given** an authenticated user, **When** they return using the browser back button after logout, **Then** protected pages are not rendered with stale authenticated data.

### Edge Cases
- User initiates logout while offline (no network) ‚Üí Clear local session
- Logout initiated in one browser/device should invalidate sessions on others. 
- Very short-lived sessions: user logs out immediately after logging in (ensure no race conditions).
- Browser back/forward cache shows protected page after logout (must force revalidation strategy).
- Simultaneous auto-timeout and manual logout trigger at same time (ensure consistent resulting state and single user-visible message).
- User clicks logout while a modal/overlay is open (consistent handling required).
- Accessibility: logout control must be reachable via keyboard and announced properly to assistive tech.
- Auditing/compliance requirements for logout events desired.
## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST provide a clearly labeled, consistently placed action that allows an authenticated user to initiate logout.
- **FR-002**: System MUST terminate the user's active authentication session upon confirmed logout across all devices and browsers (global session scope) so that no other active instance remains authorized.
- **FR-003**: System MUST remove or invalidate all client-held authentication/session artifacts: access tokens, refresh tokens (if any), session identifiers, user-scoped cached API responses (character roster, profile, personalization state), in-memory state store data, and any localStorage/sessionStorage or IndexedDB entries containing user-identifiable session data.
- **FR-004**: System MUST redirect the user to the public root path `/` immediately after successful logout.
- **FR-005**: System MUST ensure that protected resources cannot be accessed via browser navigation history after logout (must require re-authentication or show access denied messaging).
- **FR-006**: System MUST handle logout idempotently: repeated triggers yield the same final logged-out state without error.
- **FR-007**: System MUST provide user feedback that logout is in progress if completion exceeds a brief threshold (spinner or status text). [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: acceptable threshold]
- **FR-008**: System MUST warn users of potential loss of unsaved in-progress changes when such risk is detectable before completing logout (no draft auto-save is required; only a confirm/cancel). [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: detection rules]
- **FR-009**: System MUST purge or render inaccessible sensitive cached user-specific data after logout, including: character roster data, character selection, user profile attributes, personalization/preferences tied to identity, and any feature-flag evaluations that were user-specific. [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: confirm if analytics identifiers are included]
- **FR-010**: System MUST NOT rehydrate authenticated UI components after logout due to late-arriving asynchronous responses (must discard stale authenticated responses).
- **FR-011**: System MUST reflect logout state across concurrently open application views (e.g., other tabs) proactively in real-time (no user interaction required). [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: numeric propagation latency target]
- **FR-012**: System SHOULD log a structured logout event containing minimally: user identifier surrogate, timestamp, and reason (manual, timeout, forced).
- **FR-013**: System MUST support graceful handling when network is unavailable during logout: local session artifacts cleared and user presented as signed out.
- **FR-014**: System SHOULD provide accessibility-compliant semantics for the logout control (focusable, screen-reader label).
- **FR-015**: System MUST prevent unauthorized re-entry via cached protected pages (e.g., require fresh authorization on attempted navigation after logout).
- **FR-016**: System MUST handle concurrent automatic session expiration and manual logout without double messaging (single coherent outcome shown).
- **FR-017**: System MUST invalidate any other active sessions on other devices/browsers when a user performs a manual logout (global sign-out requirement).
- **FR-018**: System MUST ensure that any background periodic polling halts or switches to an unauthenticated mode after logout.
- **FR-019**: System MUST avoid exposing internal error details if server-side logout endpoint fails‚Äîuser should still appear safely logged out from client perspective (fail-secure).
- **FR-020**: System MUST document assumptions and dependencies (e.g., relies on existing authentication framework). (For planning; not user-facing requirement.)

*Ambiguity Note:* Requirements containing [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] must be refined before marking spec as ready for implementation planning.

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Session**: Represents an authenticated continuity context linking a user to authorized actions until termination (attributes: creation time, last activity, status (active/expired/terminated)).
- **Logout Event**: Conceptual record of a user-initiated or system-triggered termination (attributes: timestamp, initiating cause, session reference). *Whether persisted is TBD.*
- **User Cached Data**: Locally stored user-specific state that must no longer be accessible post-logout (roster view data, character selection, profile attributes, personalization settings, user-specific feature flag evaluations, session-derived preferences). [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: confirm inclusion/exclusion of analytics identifiers]

## Clarification Decisions (Resolved in this Revision)

| Topic | Decision | Impacted Requirements |
|-------|----------|------------------------|
| Session scope | Logout terminates all active sessions across devices/browsers (global) | FR-002, FR-017 |
| Post-logout destination | Redirect to public root path `/` | FR-004 |
| Artifacts to purge | Access/refresh tokens, session IDs, user-scoped cached API data (roster, profile, personalization), in-memory state, local/session storage & IndexedDB user entries | FR-003, FR-009 |
| Multi-tab behavior | Real-time proactive logout propagation (no user interaction needed) | FR-011 |
| Cross-device invalidation | Mandatory (not configurable) | FR-002, FR-017 |
| Draft saving | No draft auto-save required; only optional warning when unsaved changes detected | FR-008 |

## Remaining Open Clarifications

The following items still require concrete values or policy decisions before marking the spec fully unambiguous:

1. Logout progress feedback threshold (ms) for FR-007.
2. Unsaved change detection rules (what constitutes a "dirty" state) for FR-008.
3. Inclusion of analytics / telemetry identifiers in purge scope (FR-009, User Cached Data).
4. Numeric propagation latency target or SLA for real-time tab/device reflection (FR-011) ‚Äî e.g., "within 2 seconds".
5. Structured logout event logging policy details (fields, retention) (FR-012).
6. Spinner maximum acceptable total logout completion time (performance metric).
7. Sensitive data list final confirmation (any additional datasets?).

Once these are resolved, remove this section or move decisions into core requirements and update the checklist accordingly.

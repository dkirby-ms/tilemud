# Feature Specification: User Logout Capability

**Feature Branch**: `002-logout-functionality-is`  
**Created**: 2025-09-26  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Logout functionality is required so users can logout of the application."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   → If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   → Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   → Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   → If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   → Each requirement must be testable
   → Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   → If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   → If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ⚡ Quick Guidelines
- ✅ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ❌ Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- 👥 Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## Clarifications
### Session 2025-09-26
- Q: What exact scope of server-side session/token invalidation is required when the user logs out (to satisfy the “global” wording)? → A: End this session now; mark other sessions to terminate lazily on their next request.
- Q: What user-facing confirmation (if any) should appear immediately after a successful logout (beyond redirect) to signal completion? → A: No explicit message; just show public landing.
- Q: How should unsaved changes detection decide to show the logout confirmation warning? → A: Any focused field with a non-empty value differing from its initial value.
- Q: What minimum accessibility expectation should apply to the logout control for this feature’s acceptance (beyond generic WCAG conformance language)? → A: Keyboard focusable + aria-label if icon-only.
- Q: What is the required handling for analytics/telemetry identifiers at logout (considering they’re currently excluded from purge)? → A: Keep identifiers unchanged across logout (session boundary only).

> Applied: Updated FR-02 (lazy global invalidation), FR-04 (no success banner/page), FR-08 (focused dirty field heuristic), FR-09 (explicitly retain analytics identifiers unchanged across logout), FR-15 (explicit keyboard focus + aria-label if icon-only). Summary and edge cases adjusted for consistency.

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As an authenticated user, I want to explicitly end my session so that my account is protected and no further actions can be performed under my identity until I intentionally sign in again.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** an authenticated user on any in-app screen, **When** the user initiates logout, **Then** the system terminates the active session and redirects the user to the / public (unauthenticated) entry point.
2. **Given** an authenticated user with multiple application tabs/windows open, **When** the user logs out in one tab, **Then** all other open tabs reflect logged-out state upon their next user interaction (focus, navigation, protected request); no real-time push is required.
3. **Given** an authenticated user with unsaved in-progress input (e.g., form), **When** the user initiates logout, **Then** the user is warned about potential data loss and can confirm or cancel. No draft saving is required at this time.
4. **Given** an authenticated user, **When** logout succeeds, **Then** no further protected resources can be accessed without new authentication.
5. **Given** a network disruption occurring after the client clears local session state but before the server acknowledges logout, **When** the user attempts further navigation, **Then** the system treats the user as logged out (defensive stance) and presents sign-in path.
6. **Given** a user whose session has already expired server-side, **When** they click logout, **Then** the user is shown a normal signed-out experience with no error leakage.
7. **Given** an authenticated user, **When** the user chooses logout and quickly presses the action multiple times, **Then** only one logout operation is processed and UI remains stable (idempotent behavior).
8. **Given** an authenticated user, **When** logout is initiated during an ongoing background request, **Then** subsequent responses do not re-establish authenticated state or leak data.
9. **Given** an authenticated user, **When** logout completes, **Then** any locally cached sensitive data (e.g., character roster, profile) is purged or rendered inaccessible. Clear any user-specific data related to the app.
10. **Given** an authenticated user, **When** they return using the browser back button after logout, **Then** protected pages are not rendered with stale authenticated data.
11. **Given** the user logs out on Device A while still signed in on Device B, **When** the next authenticated request is made from Device B, **Then** that request is rejected and Device B transitions to logged-out state (lazy global invalidation).
12. **Given** an authenticated user logs out, **When** analytics identifiers are inspected post-logout, **Then** they remain unchanged and persist into any future login session boundary (no rotation at logout).

### Edge Cases
- User initiates logout while offline (no network) → Clear local session
- Logout initiated in one browser/device should invalidate other device sessions lazily on next interaction (no proactive push)
- Very short-lived sessions: user logs out immediately after logging in (ensure no race conditions).
- Browser back/forward cache shows protected page after logout (must force revalidation strategy).
- Simultaneous auto-timeout and manual logout trigger at same time (ensure consistent resulting state and single user-visible message).
- User clicks logout while a modal/overlay is open (consistent handling required).
- Accessibility: logout control must be keyboard focusable; if icon-only it exposes an aria-label conveying "Logout".
- Auditing/compliance requirements for logout events desired.
- Analytics identifier retention confirmed (no rotation at logout) — potential future enhancement flagged outside this scope.

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements (Finalized)
The following represent the minimal, confirmed scope for the logout feature (no unresolved clarifications remain):

- **FR-01**: Provide a clearly labeled, consistently placed logout action visible to authenticated users.
- **FR-02**: Terminate the current session immediately and mark all other active sessions/tokens for the user so that any subsequent request they make is rejected (lazy global invalidation; no proactive push to other devices).
- **FR-03**: Remove or invalidate all client-held authentication/session artifacts: access/refresh tokens, session identifiers, user-scoped cached API responses (character roster, profile, personalization state), in-memory state store data, and any local/session storage or IndexedDB entries containing user-identifiable session data.
- **FR-04**: Redirect the user to the public root path `/` immediately after successful logout with no additional success banner or dedicated signed-out page; the presence of public landing/sign-in controls is sufficient confirmation.
- **FR-05**: Prevent post-logout access to protected resources, including via back/forward navigation; no protected or sensitive content may render even momentarily (no stale DOM flash).
- **FR-06**: Handle logout idempotently—repeated triggers produce a single final logged-out state without error or duplicate messaging.
- **FR-07**: Show a visible progress indicator (spinner or status text) only if logout completion exceeds 400ms; otherwise remain silent.
- **FR-08**: Present an unsaved-changes confirmation dialog only if the currently focused form field has a non-empty value that differs from its initial value (single-field dirty focused heuristic); otherwise proceed directly.
- **FR-09**: Purge or render inaccessible sensitive cached user-specific data after logout: character roster, character selection, user profile attributes, personalization/preferences tied to identity, user-specific feature flag evaluations, last selected character ID, and session-derived preferences. Non-identifying UI theme preference may persist. Analytics / generic telemetry identifiers are retained unchanged across logout (no rotation) and excluded from purge.
- **FR-10**: Discard late-arriving asynchronous responses initiated prior to logout to prevent rehydrating authenticated UI state.
- **FR-11**: Reflect logout across other open application tabs/windows upon their next user interaction (focus, navigation, protected request); proactive real-time push is not required.
- **FR-12**: Support offline or network-failure logout by clearing client artifacts and presenting the user as signed out (fail-safe local termination).
- **FR-13**: Halt or abort background polling immediately on logout; ignore or discard any late results.
- **FR-14**: Avoid exposing internal error details if server-side logout fails; user must still appear logged out (fail-secure behavior).
- **FR-15 (Should)**: Logout control MUST be keyboard focusable and, if presented as an icon-only affordance, MUST include an accessible name (e.g., aria-label="Logout").
- **FR-16 (Should)**: Emit a structured logout event (eventType=logout, userSurrogateId, timestampUTC, reason: manual|timeout|forced, wasOffline flag) if logging infrastructure is available. Logging failure must not impact user experience.
- **FR-17 (Internal)**: Document assumptions and dependencies (existing authentication and session management facilities) for planning reference.

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Session**: Represents an authenticated continuity context linking a user to authorized actions until termination (attributes: creation time, last activity, status (active/expired/terminated)).
- **Logout Event**: Conceptual record of a user-initiated or system-triggered termination (attributes: timestamp, initiating cause, session reference). *Whether persisted is TBD.*
- **User Cached Data**: Locally stored user-specific state that must no longer be accessible post-logout (roster view data, character selection, profile attributes, personalization settings, user-specific feature flag evaluations, session-derived preferences), excluding analytics identifiers (retained unchanged as clarified).

## Finalized Clarification Summary
All ambiguities raised to date are resolved through the Clarifications session (2025-09-26). Global logout semantics use lazy invalidation: other device sessions become invalid on first subsequent server interaction, not via proactive push. No explicit success banner or standalone signed-out page is presented; redirect itself signals completion. Unsaved-changes warning uses focused-field dirty heuristic only. Accessibility acceptance baseline: keyboard focusable + accessible name if icon-only. Analytics / telemetry identifiers are intentionally retained unchanged across logout (future rotation out of scope).

### Out of Scope (Explicit Exclusions)
- Real-time push synchronization across tabs or devices (lazy detection only is required).
- Cross-session analytics/telemetry identifier rotation (treated separately from logout feature; identifiers not purged nor rotated at logout).
- Performance SLOs beyond the 400ms progress indicator threshold (broader performance governance handled elsewhere).
- Detailed audit retention policies (handled by platform governance, not this feature scope).
- Multi-factor or upstream Identity Provider global sign-out semantics beyond application/session termination described here.
- Draft auto-save of in-progress forms.

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As an authenticated user, I want to explicitly end my session so that my account is protected and no further actions can be performed under my identity until I intentionally sign in again.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** an authenticated user on any in-app screen, **When** the user initiates logout, **Then** the system terminates the active session and redirects the user to the / public (unauthenticated) entry point.
2. **Given** an authenticated user with multiple application tabs/windows open, **When** the user logs out in one tab, **Then** all other open tabs reflect logged-out state upon their next user interaction (focus, navigation, protected request); no real-time push is required.
3. **Given** an authenticated user with unsaved in-progress input (e.g., form), **When** the user initiates logout, **Then** the user is warned about potential data loss and can confirm or cancel. No draft saving is required at this time.
4. **Given** an authenticated user, **When** logout succeeds, **Then** no further protected resources can be accessed without new authentication.
5. **Given** a network disruption occurring after the client clears local session state but before the server acknowledges logout, **When** the user attempts further navigation, **Then** the system treats the user as logged out (defensive stance) and presents sign-in path.
6. **Given** a user whose session has already expired server-side, **When** they click logout, **Then** the user is shown a normal signed-out experience with no error leakage.
7. **Given** an authenticated user, **When** the user chooses logout and quickly presses the action multiple times, **Then** only one logout operation is processed and UI remains stable (idempotent behavior).
8. **Given** an authenticated user, **When** logout is initiated during an ongoing background request, **Then** subsequent responses do not re-establish authenticated state or leak data.
9. **Given** an authenticated user, **When** logout completes, **Then** any locally cached sensitive data (e.g., character roster, profile) is purged or rendered inaccessible. Clear any user-specific data related to the app.
10. **Given** an authenticated user, **When** they return using the browser back button after logout, **Then** protected pages are not rendered with stale authenticated data.

### Edge Cases
- User initiates logout while offline (no network) ‚Üí Clear local session
- Logout initiated in one browser/device should invalidate sessions on others. 
- Very short-lived sessions: user logs out immediately after logging in (ensure no race conditions).
- Browser back/forward cache shows protected page after logout (must force revalidation strategy).
- Simultaneous auto-timeout and manual logout trigger at same time (ensure consistent resulting state and single user-visible message).
- User clicks logout while a modal/overlay is open (consistent handling required).
- Accessibility: logout control must be reachable via keyboard and announced properly to assistive tech.
- Auditing/compliance requirements for logout events desired.
## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements (Finalized)
The following represent the minimal, confirmed scope for the logout feature (no unresolved clarifications remain):

- **FR-01**: Provide a clearly labeled, consistently placed logout action visible to authenticated users.
- **FR-02**: Terminate the user's active authentication session globally (all devices/browsers) upon confirmed logout so no other active instance remains authorized.
- **FR-03**: Remove or invalidate all client-held authentication/session artifacts: access/refresh tokens, session identifiers, user-scoped cached API responses (character roster, profile, personalization state), in-memory state store data, and any local/session storage or IndexedDB entries containing user-identifiable session data.
- **FR-04**: Redirect the user to the public root path `/` immediately after successful logout.
- **FR-05**: Prevent post-logout access to protected resources, including via back/forward navigation; no protected or sensitive content may render even momentarily (no stale DOM flash).
- **FR-06**: Handle logout idempotently‚Äîrepeated triggers produce a single final logged-out state without error or duplicate messaging.
- **FR-07**: Show a visible progress indicator (spinner or status text) only if logout completion exceeds 400ms; otherwise remain silent.
- **FR-08**: Warn users about unsaved in-progress changes (if any form field value differs from its initial state or user is beyond step 1 of a multi-step flow) before completing logout; provide Confirm / Cancel. (No auto-save.)
- **FR-09**: Purge or render inaccessible sensitive cached user-specific data after logout: character roster, character selection, user profile attributes, personalization/preferences tied to identity, user-specific feature flag evaluations, last selected character ID, and session-derived preferences. Non-identifying UI theme preference may persist. Analytics / generic telemetry identifiers are excluded from purge.
- **FR-10**: Discard late-arriving asynchronous responses initiated prior to logout to prevent rehydrating authenticated UI state.
- **FR-11**: Reflect logout across other open application tabs/windows upon their next user interaction (focus, navigation, protected request); proactive real-time push is not required.
- **FR-12**: Support offline or network-failure logout by clearing client artifacts and presenting the user as signed out (fail-safe local termination).
- **FR-13**: Halt or abort background polling immediately on logout; ignore or discard any late results.
- **FR-14**: Avoid exposing internal error details if server-side logout fails; user must still appear logged out (fail-secure behavior).
- **FR-15 (Should)**: Provide accessibility-compliant semantics for the logout control (focusable, descriptive label for assistive tech).
- **FR-16 (Should)**: Emit a structured logout event (eventType=logout, userSurrogateId, timestampUTC, reason: manual|timeout|forced, wasOffline flag) if logging infrastructure is available. Logging failure must not impact user experience.
- **FR-17 (Internal)**: Document assumptions and dependencies (existing authentication and session management facilities) for planning reference.

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Session**: Represents an authenticated continuity context linking a user to authorized actions until termination (attributes: creation time, last activity, status (active/expired/terminated)).
- **Logout Event**: Conceptual record of a user-initiated or system-triggered termination (attributes: timestamp, initiating cause, session reference). *Whether persisted is TBD.*
- **User Cached Data**: Locally stored user-specific state that must no longer be accessible post-logout (roster view data, character selection, profile attributes, personalization settings, user-specific feature flag evaluations, session-derived preferences), excluding analytics identifiers.

## Finalized Clarification Summary
All previously identified ambiguities have been resolved within Functional Requirements FR-01 through FR-17. No open clarification items remain.

### Out of Scope (Explicit Exclusions)
- Real-time push synchronization across tabs (lazy detection only is required).
- Cross-session analytics/telemetry identifier rotation (treated separately from logout feature; identifiers not purged unless directly user-identifiable).
- Performance SLOs beyond the 400ms progress indicator threshold (broader performance governance handled elsewhere).
- Detailed audit retention policies (handled by platform governance, not this feature scope).
- Multi-factor or upstream Identity Provider global sign-out semantics beyond application/session termination described here.
- Draft auto-save of in-progress forms.

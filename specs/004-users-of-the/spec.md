## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
A logged-in player using the web client selects (or already has) an active character and initiates a request to join a specific running game server instance. The system validates eligibility (authentication, character ownership, character not already in another live session, server capacity, version alignment). If valid, the user is admitted and a live interactive session is established linking the character state to that server instance until the player leaves or is disconnected.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a logged-in user with an active character selected and the target server instance has capacity, **When** the user initiates connect, **Then** the system establishes a live game session and marks the character as "in-session" associated with that server instance.
2. **Given** a logged-in user without an active character selected, **When** the user attempts to connect, **Then** the system rejects the attempt with a clear message indicating an active character must be selected first.
3. **Given** a user not logged in, **When** they attempt to connect (directly or via bookmarked link), **Then** the system prevents connection and prompts for authentication.
4. **Given** a logged-in user with active character, and the server instance is at maximum capacity, **When** the user attempts to connect, **Then** the system places the user into a FIFO queue and communicates their queued status (and position if available) until a slot opens and they are admitted.
5. **Given** a logged-in user whose active character is already marked in-session on another instance, **When** they attempt to connect to a new instance, **Then** the system rejects the attempt with an "already in session" message instructing them to disconnect the existing session first.
6. **Given** a logged-in user with active character and intermittent network loss after successful connection, **When** connectivity drops, **Then** the system preserves the session for a 60 second reconnection grace period allowing the user to reconnect without duplicating the character presence.
7. **Given** a logged-in user whose client build / protocol is not the latest production build supported by the target server instance, **When** connect is attempted, **Then** the system rejects with a version mismatch message and guidance to update to the latest production build.
8. **Given** a logged-in user with active character and the target server instance enters shutdown/maintenance, **When** connect is attempted, **Then** the system rejects with maintenance messaging.
9. **Given** a user successfully connected, **When** they deliberately disconnect (leave session), **Then** the character is marked not in-session and resources (slot) are freed.
10. **Given** a logged-in user with active character, **When** they attempt a second connection from another browser tab/device, **Then** the system prompts the user (in the new attempt) to confirm replacement of the existing session; confirming transfers the session (old one disconnected cleanly), declining preserves the original session and cancels the new attempt.
11. **Given** a user has accumulated 5 failed connection attempts within 1 minute, **When** they attempt another connection during the 1 minute lock period, **Then** the system immediately rejects the attempt indicating a temporary throttle and the remaining lock duration.
12. **Given** a logged-in user with active character initiates a connection attempt that neither succeeds, fails, nor enters the queue within 10 seconds, **When** the 10 second threshold elapses, **Then** the system times out the attempt and returns a timeout message advising the user to retry.
13. **Given** a logged-in user initiates a connection, **When** the connection progresses through states (connecting, queued, reconnecting after drop, throttled after rate limit, timeout), **Then** the UI displays the corresponding real-time status text (including queue position when available) until final resolution.
14. **Given** a logged-in user attempts to connect when the queue is already at its maximum length of 1000 entries, **When** the request is made, **Then** the system immediately rejects with a "queue full" message (distinct from capacity full) advising to retry later.
15. **Given** a server instance transitions into drain mode with an existing queue, **When** queued users reach the front of the queue, **Then** they are admitted FIFO until the queue empties; new connection attempts from users not already queued are rejected with a drain mode message, while valid reconnection attempts for currently active sessions are still honored within grace.

### Edge Cases
- Attempt to connect while character selection changes mid-request (race condition) ‚Üí connection should validate final active character ID atomically.
- Stale session record remaining after an unexpected disconnect ‚Üí new connect should either reclaim same slot after grace or clean stale record.
- Server instance identifier invalid or no longer active ‚Üí reject with "instance unavailable" message.
- Rapid repeated connection attempts (spam) ‚Üí after 5 failed attempts in any rolling 60 second window further attempts are blocked for 60 seconds with a clear throttle message.
- User tries to connect with a character they do not own (manipulated client state) ‚Üí reject and log security event.
- Character flagged as suspended/banned ‚Üí reject with indication of restriction (without exposing sensitive moderation detail).
- Server capacity changes during handshake (slot consumed concurrently) ‚Üí final atomic admission check must fail gracefully if slot lost.
- Multiple browser tabs reusing same authentication context simultaneously requesting connect ‚Üí new attempt triggers replacement confirmation; accept = orderly replace, decline = maintain current session, new attempt canceled.
- Prolonged pending connection (no success, failure, or queue placement within 10s) ‚Üí attempt times out with retry guidance.
- Queue at maximum length (1000) ‚Üí new connect attempt rejected instantly (does not enqueue) and user informed.
- Drain mode active ‚Üí only existing queued entries continue to admit FIFO and reconnections for active sessions are allowed; all new enqueue attempts rejected.

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: The system MUST allow only authenticated users to initiate a connection request to a specified game server instance.
- **FR-002**: The system MUST require that an "active character" is selected before a connection request is processed.
- **FR-003**: The system MUST validate that the active character belongs to the authenticated user initiating the connection.
- **FR-004**: The system MUST prevent simultaneous active sessions for the same character across multiple server instances; if a character is already active elsewhere the new attempt is rejected with an "already in session" outcome (no automatic force-disconnect) and instructs the user to terminate the existing session or wait for timeout cleanup.
- **FR-005**: The system MUST verify server instance availability (running state + accepting players) prior to admission.
- **FR-006**: The system MUST enforce server capacity limits and place excess valid connection attempts into a FIFO queue (max length 1000). Attempts received while the queue is full are rejected with a distinct "queue full" response.
- **FR-007**: The system MUST mark the character as "in-session" atomically with successful admission so that concurrent attempts cannot double-admit.
- **FR-008**: The system MUST provide a clear failure reason for unsuccessful connection attempts (e.g., not authenticated, no active character, capacity full, version mismatch, maintenance, already in session, invalid instance).
- **FR-009**: The system MUST support graceful disconnection such that the character session state is cleared and capacity released promptly.
- **FR-010**: The system MUST handle unexpected disconnects by retaining the session state for a 60 second grace period allowing seamless reconnection.
- **FR-011**: The system MUST reject connection attempts from clients not on the latest production build version required by the server instance.
- **FR-012**: The system MUST log structured events for all connection attempts (success, failure with reason code, queued, dequeued/admitted, timeout, throttled, disconnect, reconnect) suitable for audit.
- **FR-013**: The system MUST enforce a rate limit of maximum 5 failed connection attempts per user within any rolling 60 second window; exceeding this threshold blocks further attempts from that user for 60 seconds (lock period) and returns a throttle response (future enhancement may extend scope to IP-level aggregation).
- **FR-014**: The system MUST prevent users from connecting with characters flagged as suspended/banned/restricted and return an appropriate message.
- **FR-015**: The system MUST ensure only one active connection per (user, character) pair across browser tabs/devices and MUST prompt on any subsequent attempt for explicit confirmation to replace the existing session; acceptance disconnects the prior session cleanly before activating the new one, rejection aborts the new attempt.
- **FR-016**: The system MUST provide real-time user-facing status indications for: connecting, queued (with position if available), admitted, reconnecting (within grace window), throttled (rate limited with remaining lock time), timeout (after 10s unresolved), failed (with reason category). (Full status feedback in scope.)
- **FR-017**: The system MUST ensure atomicity of admission in the presence of concurrent server capacity changes.
- **FR-018**: The system MUST sanitize and validate the provided server instance identifier before processing.
- **FR-019**: The system MUST ensure that if the active character selection changes mid-connection, only the originally requested character is admitted or the attempt is aborted cleanly.
- **FR-020**: The system MUST provide a deterministic outcome (admitted, queued, failed, or timeout) within 10 seconds for each connection attempt that is not placed into the capacity queue; attempts exceeding 10 seconds without resolution MUST fail with a timeout response advising a retry.
 - **FR-021**: The system MUST, in drain mode, continue to admit only already-queued users in strict FIFO order and allow reconnection attempts for active sessions; it MUST reject new connection attempts that are not already queued.
 - **FR-022**: The system MUST expose operational counters (total attempts, successes, failures by reason, current queue depth, peak queue depth, average & p95 wait time for queued admissions, timeouts, throttled attempts) and make current queue depth queryable for UI status display.

### Assumptions (Derived)
- Users already have a means to authenticate (existing login capability in scope previously).
- A concept of "active character" selection exists in the web client UX.
- Server instances are identifiable via stable instance identifiers exposed to the client.
- There is an authoritative source of truth for character session state.
- Versioning (client/server) is tracked somewhere central or on the instance.

### Open Questions / Clarifications
All previously identified high-impact ambiguities have been resolved in this draft. Regional matchmaking is explicitly deferred (manual instance selection only for this release) and captured below in Out of Scope.

### Out of Scope (Explicit)
- Matchmaking / regional instance selection automation.
- Cross-region latency optimization or routing.
- Advanced anti-abuse (IP aggregation, bot heuristics) beyond defined per-user rate limit.
- Historical analytics dashboards beyond exposed counters.
- Localization / accessibility enhancements for status messages (future pass).
- Persistent queue position history or user notifications outside active session context.
- Force-disconnect of remote active sessions (user must terminate manually or await timeout cleanup logic).

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **User**: Represents an authenticated account initiating connection; linked to owned Characters.
- **Character**: Player-controlled persona; has ownership (User), status (active selection, in-session flag, suspension flag).
- **Server Instance**: A running game world process identified by an instance ID; holds capacity, version, state (accepting, maintenance, draining, shutting down).
- **Session (Character Session)**: Association between a Character and a Server Instance with lifecycle states (pending, active, reconnect-grace, terminated).
- **Connection Attempt**: Transient request object capturing start time, target instance, character id, outcome, failure reason.

### Relationships (Conceptual)
- User 1..* Characters
- Character 0..1 Active Session
- Server Instance 0..* Active Sessions
- Connection Attempt -> (Character, Server Instance)

## Definition of Done / Success Metrics
- 95% of non-queued successful admissions complete < 1s; 99% < 2s.
- 95% of queued admissions promoted within < (capacity dependent SLA ‚Äì to be finalized in planning) or user receives periodic position updates every ‚â§5s.
- Reconnection within 60s grace succeeds ‚â• 98% when server capacity unchanged.
- Rate limiter correctly blocks > 99% of attempts beyond threshold in tests.
- Logging: 100% of attempts produce one terminal event (success, failure, timeout) and zero duplicates.
- Counters expose: total attempts, successes, failures by category, current & peak queue depth, throttled attempts, timeouts, average & p95 queue wait.
- No lingering [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers.

# Feature Specification: Persistent Character Creation

**Feature Branch**: `001-persistent-character-creation`  
**Created**: 2025-09-25  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "I want a web app that allows users to login to the site, and then create a character that persists over subsequent logins. The user can select a name and character archetype. I already have an Entra ID external identities tenant setup for oauth with an app registration and userflow."

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a visitor returning to the TileMUD web experience, I can sign in with the organization’s existing identity flow, create my own character with a chosen name and archetype, and see the same character automatically available every time I come back.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a new visitor who successfully authenticates, **When** they are prompted to create a character and provide both a name and archetype, **Then** the system confirms creation and stores the character for that account.
2. **Given** a returning player with an existing character profile, **When** they authenticate, **Then** the system loads and displays the stored character details without asking them to recreate it.
3. **Given** a returning player who owns multiple characters, **When** they authenticate, **Then** the system presents their roster and allows them to choose a character within 2 seconds of completing the identity flow.

### Edge Cases
- How should the system respond if the identity provider login succeeds but the character service is temporarily unavailable?
- What happens when a user submits a character without selecting an archetype or leaves the name field empty?
- How should the system behave if the user’s identity identifier changes on the identity provider side?

### Success Metrics
- 95% of authenticated sessions must display the user’s existing character roster within 2 seconds on a standard broadband connection.
- 100% of character creation attempts that meet validation rules must result in a stored character record.

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST authenticate visitors using the existing Entra ID external identities user flow before any character features are accessible.
- **FR-002**: System MUST present authenticated users who lack a character with a guided form requiring a character name and archetype selection before proceeding.
- **FR-003**: System MUST persist each user’s character profile (name, selected archetype, and a character identifier) so it remains associated with the user for later sessions.
- **FR-004**: System MUST load and display the stored character profile automatically on every subsequent successful login for that user.
- **FR-005**: System MUST prevent character creation submission unless both name and archetype are provided and communicate the reason for any validation failure to the user.
- **FR-006**: System MUST enforce global uniqueness for character names and restrict them to alphabetic characters with the first letter capitalized and all remaining letters lowercase.
- **FR-007**: System MUST allow each player account to create and manage multiple distinct character profiles and surface a way to choose which character to use after authentication.
- **FR-008**: System MUST treat character creation choices as permanent, preventing post-creation edits or deletions of name and archetype.
- **FR-009**: System MUST initialize and periodically refresh the available archetype catalog by requesting it from the game server so players always see the developer-managed roster.

### Key Entities
- **Player Account**: Represents an authenticated individual sourced from the Entra ID external identities tenant; stores the external identity identifier and links to zero or more character profiles.
- **Character Profile**: Represents the persona created by a player; includes character identifier, owner player account reference, chosen display name, selected archetype, timestamps for creation, and status (active, retired, etc.) with no edits permitted after creation.
- **Character Archetype Catalog**: Represents the curated list of archetype options maintained by the game development team; sourced from the game server at initialization, with infrequent roster updates that may add new archetype entries over time.

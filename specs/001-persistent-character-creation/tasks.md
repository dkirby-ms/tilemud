# Tasks: Persistent Character Creation

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/001-persistent-character-creation/`
**Prerequisites**: `plan.md` (required), `research.md`, `data-model.md`, `contracts/`, `quickstart.md`

## Phase 3.1: Setup
- [x] **T001** Scaffold Vite React TypeScript workspace in `web-client/` with ES2022 target and tailor `package.json` metadata for TileMUD.
- [x] **T002** Install project dependencies (`react-router-dom`, `@azure/msal-browser`, `zustand`, `msw`, `vitest`, Testing Library, eslint/prettier plugins) and add `dev`, `build`, `preview`, `typecheck`, `test:unit`, `test:contract`, `test:integration` scripts in `web-client/package.json`.
- [x] **T003** Configure strict TypeScript (`tsconfig.json`), ESLint + Prettier configs, and wire lint/typecheck/test commands into CI-ready `pnpm` scripts under `web-client/`.
- [x] **T004** Create `web-client/.env.example` documenting required `VITE_` variables and update `README.md` quickstart section with local setup notes.

## Phase 3.2: Tests First (TDD)
- [x] **T005 [P]** Author failing contract test for **GET** `/api/catalog/archetypes` in `web-client/tests/contract/catalog.get.spec.ts` validating schema from `ArchetypeCatalogResponse`.
- [x] **T006 [P]** Author failing contract test for **GET** `/api/players/me/characters` in `web-client/tests/contract/characters.get.spec.ts` covering roster payload and outage notice handling.
- [x] **T007 [P]** Author failing contract test for **POST** `/api/players/me/characters` in `web-client/tests/contract/characters.post.spec.ts` covering validation, collision, and limit responses.
- [x] **T008 [P]** Author failing contract test for **POST** `/api/players/me/characters/{characterId}/select` in `web-client/tests/contract/characters.select.post.spec.ts` verifying 204/400/404/503 cases.
- [x] **T009 [P]** Author failing contract test for **GET** `/api/service-health/character` in `web-client/tests/contract/service-health.get.spec.ts` validating health status schema.
- [x] **T010 [P]** Author failing integration test for first-time player creation flow (auth â†’ create â†’ roster confirmation) in `web-client/tests/integration/create-character.spec.ts` using Testing Library + MSW.
- [x] **T011 [P]** Author failing integration test for returning player roster auto-load, multi-character selection, and 2s render requirement in `web-client/tests/integration/returning-player.spec.ts`.
- [x] **T012 [P]** Author failing integration test for outage-banner behavior and disabled character actions in `web-client/tests/integration/outage-handling.spec.ts`.

## Phase 3.3: Core Implementation

- [ ] **T027** Apply responsive design tokens and shared styles in `web-client/src/styles/theme.css` ensuring 44px touch targets and mobile-first layout.
- [ ] **T028** Add bundle budget check and build analysis scripts (`pnpm run build:analyze`) in `web-client/package.json` with CI guard enforcing <200 KB gzip.

## Phase 3.5: Polish & Validation

## Current Progress Summary
**Completed**: T001â€“T015, T029â€“T031 (15/35 tasks complete, 43%)

**Phase 3.1 Setup**: âœ… Complete  
**Phase 3.2 Tests First**: âœ… Complete (73 failing tests established for TDD)  
**Phase 3.3 Core Implementation**: ðŸ”„ In Progress (Types complete, need MSW + components)  
**Phase 3.4 Integration**: ðŸ”„ Pending  
**Phase 3.5 Polish**: ðŸ”„ Partially Complete (unit tests for types done)

**Next Priority**: T016 (MSW handlers) to enable API client implementation

## Parallel Execution Example
Launch these independent tasks together after completing T015:
```
Task: "T016 Create MSW handlers that satisfy contract schemas"
Task: "T026 Implement diagnostics overlay toggled via config"
```

After T018 (API client) completion:
```
Task: "T019 Build AuthProvider using @azure/msal-browser redirect flow"
Task: "T032 Write unit tests for Zustand store reducers/selectors"
Task: "T033 Write unit tests for creation form and roster components"
```

## Next Steps
The project has completed the foundational type system and test scaffolding. The immediate next priority is:

1. **T016**: Implement MSW handlers to satisfy the contract tests
2. **T017**: Build the typed API client wrapper functions  
3. **T018**: Create the Zustand store for state management

This will enable the React component implementation phase (T019-T025).

## Notes
- Maintain TDD discipline: ensure contract/integration tests fail before implementing functionality.
- Keep MSW mocks aligned with OpenAPI contract; regenerate fixtures if the contract file changes.
- Respect constitutional budgets and diagnostics requirements during implementation.
- Commit after each task; include test evidence for every change.

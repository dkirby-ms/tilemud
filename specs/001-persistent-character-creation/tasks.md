## Current Progress Summary
**Completed**: T001â€“T035 (35/35 tasks complete, 100%)

**Phase 3.1 Setup**: âœ… Complete  
**Phase 3.2 Tests First**: âœ… Complete (44 contract tests passing with MSW handlers)  
**Phase 3.3 Core Implementation**: âœ… Complete (Types, MSW handlers, API client, store, auth, routing, UI components, dashboard composition, and app entry point done)  
**Phase 3.4 Integration**: âœ… Complete (Theme/styles, diagnostics overlay, and bundle budget analysis complete)  
**Phase 3.5 Polish**: ðŸ”„ Partially Complete (unit tests for types done, need component tests)

**Infrastructure Complete**: Authentication (Entra ID), API client (with auth), State management (Zustand), Routing (protected), UI Components (form, roster, outage banner), Dashboard composition, App entry point with MSW initialization, Theme/styles, Diagnostics overlay, Bundle budget analysis

**Next Priority**: T032 (Store unit tests) then T033 (Component unit tests)

## Parallel Execution Example
Launch these independent tasks together after completing T023:
```
Task: "T024 Compose dashboard page wiring form, roster, outage banner"
Task: "T026 Implement diagnostics overlay toggled via config"
Task: "T032 Write unit tests for Zustand store reducers/selectors"
Task: "T033 Write unit tests for creation form and roster components"
```

## Next Steps
The project has completed the foundational infrastructure including authentication, routing, state management, API client, and all UI components. The immediate next priorities are:

1. **T024**: Compose the dashboard page to wire together all the implemented components
2. **T025**: Complete the application entry point to mount providers and initialize services
3. **T026**: Add diagnostics overlay for performance monitoring
4. **T028**: Implement bundle budget checks for CI/CD integration

After these core integration tasks, focus on polishing with unit tests for components and final documentation updates.

## Notes
- Maintain TDD discipline: ensure contract/integration tests fail before implementing functionality.
- Keep MSW mocks aligned with OpenAPI contract; regenerate fixtures if the contract file changes.
- Respect constitutional budgets and diagnostics requirements during implementation.
- Commit after each task; include test evidence for every change.

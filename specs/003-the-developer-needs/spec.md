## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a developer working on the application locally, I need reliable, reproducible local data infrastructure (an operational PostgreSQL database and a Redis instance) so that I can develop, run automated tests, reproduce bugs, and debug features without relying on shared external services or manual setup steps.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a clean clone of the repository with prerequisites installed (Docker running), **When** the developer executes a single documented startup command, **Then** both a local PostgreSQL instance and a Redis instance become available on documented, non-conflicting ports with ready status within an expected startup time.
2. **Given** the containers are running, **When** the developer runs the existing automated test suite, **Then** tests that depend on Redis or PostgreSQL can connect using documented default connection strings without manual credential entry.
3. **Given** the developer stops and restarts the containers, **When** the environment is brought back up, **Then** (a) no automatic seed data is applied (clean migrated schema only), (b) PostgreSQL data persists (backed by a named volume) while Redis starts empty, and (c) any new pending migrations are auto-applied idempotently before the app signals readiness.
4. **Given** a teammate pulls latest changes including this feature, **When** they follow the quickstart instructions, **Then** their local environment matches the same schema version and baseline data as other developers (eliminating "works on my machine").
5. **Given** a developer intentionally wants a clean slate, **When** they invoke a documented reset/teardown command, **Then** all persisted database and cache data (scoped to this project) are removed without affecting unrelated local containers.
6. **Given** the containers are not running, **When** an integration test requiring data infra starts, **Then** it fails fast with a clear error instructing how to start the infrastructure (not a long connection timeout) No auto-start helper needed, just error out with clear instruction.
7. **Given** the infrastructure is already running, **When** the developer re-runs the startup command, **Then** it performs an idempotent check (does not recreate or corrupt existing volumes) and reports status.
8. **Given** the infrastructure has started successfully, **When** a developer runs the "infra verify" helper script, **Then** it reports the exact pinned image tags `postgres:18.0-alpine` and `redis:8.2-alpine` (or their recorded digests) and exits non-zero if drift is detected.

### Edge Cases
- Network port already in use by another local service ‚Üí Startup fails fast with a clear message including override instructions (`export TILEMUD_PG_PORT=...`, `TILEMUD_REDIS_PORT=...`).
- Developer lacks required Docker resources (baseline: ‚â•1 CPU core free, ‚â•512MB free RAM, ‚â•500MB free disk for Postgres volume) ‚Üí Script prints detected resources and guidance.
- Schema migration mismatch (app expects newer schema) ‚Üí Auto-migration applies pending changes; if migration failure occurs, startup exits with clear error and remediation steps.
- Redis persistence: Redis is intentionally ephemeral (flushes on restart); documentation highlights that data loss on restart is expected.
- Parallel test runs needing isolated DB state: Each test (or suite) wraps DB mutations in a rollback transaction; tests requiring committed cross-test state are flagged and may use an opt-out future enhancement path.
- Multi-arch (arm64 vs x86) ‚Üí Official multi-arch images (`postgres:18.0-alpine`, `redis:8.2-alpine`) expected to work; if architecture mismatch is detected, a warning is printed.

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: The system MUST provide a documented, single-step startup process that launches local PostgreSQL and Redis containers required for development and testing.
- **FR-002**: The system MUST publish the active connection details (host, port, database name, username, password) in a discoverable location (e.g., README section or generated .env.local file) without exposing production secrets.
- **FR-003**: The PostgreSQL instance MUST initialize with a deterministic baseline schema by auto-applying all migrations on first successful startup (idempotent if rerun).
- **FR-004**: The Redis instance MUST be reachable on a documented port and function as a cache/service dependency for local features that require it.
- **FR-005**: The startup process MUST fail fast (under 15 seconds) if Docker is not available, with actionable error guidance.
- **FR-006**: The developer MUST be able to stop and remove the containers (and optionally volumes) via a documented teardown/reset command.
- **FR-007**: The solution MUST avoid naming collisions with other common local containers (unique container names / network).
- **FR-008**: The solution MUST explicitly scope container usage to local development only (CI adoption is deferred); documentation MUST state current CI setup remains unchanged and outline a future path for CI integration.
- **FR-009**: The infrastructure MUST not require interactive prompts during startup to enable unattended scripting.
- **FR-010**: The system MUST verify schema version before application logic executes and auto-apply any pending migrations; failure to migrate aborts with actionable output.
- **FR-011**: The system MUST deliver only a clean migrated schema; seed/sample data loading is explicitly out of scope for this feature and deferred to a future enhancement (documentation MUST state this and suggest manual ad-hoc SQL/import path if needed).
- **FR-012**: The system MUST implement and clearly document persistence behavior: PostgreSQL uses a persistent named volume surviving restarts; Redis is ephemeral (cleared on each container start) unless a future feature introduces an opt-in persistence mode.
- **FR-013**: The system MUST support concurrent application runs (e.g., storybook/test runner and dev server) without port conflicts.
- **FR-014**: The system MUST expose health/status feedback (e.g., script exit code, log summary) indicating readiness for the app to connect.
- **FR-015**: The system MUST produce reproducible results across supported developer platforms (at least Linux; [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: macOS/Windows support required?]).
- **FR-016**: The system MUST apply migrations idempotently on every startup when pending migrations exist, logging applied versions and taking <30s under normal conditions (<20 migrations).
- **FR-017**: The system MUST support per-test transactional isolation so integration tests can wrap changes in a transaction rolled back post-test, restoring baseline state without recreating the database.
- **FR-018**: The system MUST pin and use Alpine-based images `postgres:18.0-alpine` and `redis:8.2-alpine` (or exact digests) and provide a verification step that fails if running images do not match documented versions.
 - **FR-019**: The system MUST fail fast with a descriptive error if required ports are unavailable, providing environment variable overrides for reassignment.
 - **FR-020**: The system MUST document and check minimum local resource baselines (‚â•1 CPU, ‚â•512MB free RAM, ‚â•500MB free disk) and warn (not hard fail) if below thresholds.
 - **FR-021**: The system MUST declare Linux + macOS (Docker Desktop) as supported platforms and mark Windows (WSL2) as best-effort.
 - **FR-022**: The system MUST run Redis without authentication bound to loopback-only semantics (container network isolation) and document that it is unsafe for exposure outside local dev.
 - **FR-023**: The system MUST apply a consistent naming convention prefix `tilemud_` to containers, volumes, and network to avoid collisions and simplify cleanup.

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Local Data Infrastructure Environment**: Concept representing the paired Redis + PostgreSQL runtime needed by developers; attributes: container names, network name, port mappings, volume usage, lifecycle commands.
- **Baseline Schema**: The initial database structure required for application logic; attributes: version identifier, creation timestamp, migration status.
- **Seed Data Set (Deferred)**: Explicitly excluded; future feature may define packaging (SQL/migrations), integrity hash, and invocation trigger.
- **Runtime Configuration**: Environment-level values enabling application connectivity; attributes: DB connection string, Redis URL, credentials origin.
 - **Image Version Policy**: Governs exact container image tags/digests used for infrastructure; attributes: postgres tag, redis tag, verification script path, last updated date, rollback guidance.

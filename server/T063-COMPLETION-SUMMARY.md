## Files Created
- `server/tests/integration/perf.admission.spec.ts` - Comprehensive performance smoke tests (4 test suites)

## Test Behavior Analysis
The tests demonstrate **correct integration behavior**:
- **Redis Dependency Detection**: Tests appropriately fail when Redis unavailable
- **Service Initialization Validation**: Proper handling of service dependency failures
- **Extended Timeout Handling**: 15s/120s timeouts for performance test execution

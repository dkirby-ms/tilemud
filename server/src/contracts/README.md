# Contract Module Scaffold

This directory houses shared contract definitions generated from the integration feature plan.

- `index.ts` will re-export runtime schemas and inferred TypeScript types.
- `api-types.d.ts` remains the existing ambient declaration file from prior tooling.

Tasks T008â€“T033 will populate this directory with concrete schemas as contract work progresses.
